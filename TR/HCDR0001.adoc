== Issue Description

FPT_SBT_EXT.1 states that Root of Trust is implemented in immutable code or a HW-based write-protection mechanism. HCD cPP provides no further description or additional detail on the definition for the Root of Trust in terms of its protection. “Appendix G: Glossary” also fails to provide further information on this matter.

SD includes a requirement that the TSS shall describe how the Root of Trust is immutable. However, HCD cPP is not clear on how the immutable code or HW-based write-protection is defined. The SD does not provide clear guidance on the level of assurance the evaluator shall take into consideration to confirm a compliant Root of Trust protection mechanism.


// Provide the proposed resolution agreed upon by the HIT for this Issue that is being recommended to the full HCD iTC for approval
== Proposed Resolution

* Define "Immutable" term in Glossary consistent with definition in NIST SP800-193, "Platform Firmware Resiliency Guidelines".

* Modify FPT_SBT_EXT.1 SFR to remove "HW-based write protection mechanism", relying on newly added immutable definition.



// Provide here the specific change(s) by Document, Section number, paragraph and line that is proposed to be made to the HCD cPP and/or HCD SD to resolve this issue. Include separate lists for the HCD cPP and HCD SD. For each documnent that is to be updated, include only the proposed updates for that document. 

== Document(s) To be Updated

* CPP_HCD_V1.0e,
* SD_HCD_V1.0e

== Proposed Updates


The cPP and SD are to be updated as follows:

* Add "Immutable" definition to cPP Appendix G: Glossary,
* Add "Immutable" definition to SD Appendix C: Glossary
