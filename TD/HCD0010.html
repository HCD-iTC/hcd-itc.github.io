<p>Version: 1, Published: 2024-11-18<br/></p>
<p><b>Impacted Documents<br/></b>&#8226; CPP_HCD_V1.0e,<br/>&#8226; SD_HCD_V1.0e<br/></p>
<p><b>References<br/></b>CPP, SD: FPT_SBT_EXT.1 Extended: Secure Boot<br/></p>
<p><b>Issue Description<br/></b>FPT_SBT_EXT.1 states that Root of Trust is implemented in immutable code or a HW-based write-<br/>protection mechanism. HCD cPP provides no further description or additional detail on the<br/>definition for the Root of Trust in terms of its protection. &#8220;Appendix G: Glossary&#8221; also fails to<br/>provide further information on this matter.<br/></p>
<p>SD includes a requirement that the TSS shall describe how the Root of Trust is immutable. However,<br/>HCD cPP is not clear on how the immutable code or HW-based write-protection is defined. The SD<br/>does not provide clear guidance on the level of assurance the evaluator shall take into<br/>consideration to confirm a compliant Root of Trust protection mechanism.<br/></p>
<p><b>Resolution<br/></b>&#8226; Define &quot;Immutable&quot; term in Glossary consistent with definition in NIST SP800-193, &quot;Platform<br/></p>
<p>Firmware Resiliency Guidelines&quot;.<br/>&#8226; Modify FPT_SBT_EXT.1 SFR to remove &quot;HW-based write protection mechanism&quot;, relying on<br/></p>
<p>newly added immutable definition.<br/></p>
